As part of an experiment, 30 subjects performed 6 activities wearing a smartphone on the waist. 
The acceleration and velocity of the accelerometer and the gyroscope measures has been gathered.

The aim of this analysis is to derivate from the raw data package of measures a tidy data frame 
containing average per subjects and per activity. In addition, the summary should arrange variable
