Peer Graded Assignment

Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project is my contribution to the "Getting and Cleaning Data" 
course provided on Coursera by Johns Hopkins University. It aims at demonstrating my abitility to get, 
clean, order datas with respect of professionnal exigeance of Data Science.

Script are provided along with the following elements :

	1. "run_analysis.R" : main script
	2. "databasepath.R" : source of the links to the database files
	3. "data/" : directory of the raw data package
	4. "DataSummary.txt" : result of the analysis in text format, column separated by a tab
	5. "CODEBOOKX.md" : Codebook of the Data Summary
	6. "README.md" : this file
	
	
As part of an experiment, 30 subjects performed 6 activities wearing a smartphone on the waist. 
The acceleration and velocity of the accelerometer and the gyroscope measures has been gathered.

The aim of this analysis is to derivate from the raw data package of measures a tidy data frame 
containing average per subjects and per activity. In addition, the summary should arrange variable
names to facilitate furture analysis.
